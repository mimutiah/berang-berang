# Banking Marketing Targets Project

## Project Overview
This project by <b>Berang-Berang Consulting</b> aims to enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for a bank. Our analysis utilizes the <b>"Banking Marketing Targets"</b> dataset to develop predictive models that identify potential customers likely to subscribe, thus enabling more targeted and cost-efficient marketing strategies.

## Repository Contents
<b>banking_train.xlsx</b>: Training dataset for model development.

<b>banking_test.xlsx</b>: Test dataset for model evaluation.

<b>Stage_1_FinPro_W.ipynb</b>: Jupyter Notebook containing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Pre-processing, and Outlier Handling.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Scikit-learn</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>


### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:


```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Program
<ol>
<li>Open the Jupyter Notebook:</li>

  ```
jupyter notebook Stage_1_FinPro_W.ipynb

  ```

<li>Execute the cells sequentially to perform EDA, data pre-processing, and model training.</li>
</ol>

## Using the Program
<b>EDA</b>: Explore data distributions and relationships between features.

<b>Pre-processing</b>: Clean and prepare the data for modeling by handling outliers and normalizing data.

<b>Model Training</b>: Train the predictive model using the training dataset.

<b>Evaluation</b>: Assess the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
